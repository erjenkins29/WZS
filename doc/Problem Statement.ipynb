It's important to remember that when we are solving for 70+ products, and 40+ attributes ($a_i$'s), it is likely that a solution will not be found until we subsample that set of products to around 20-40 products.  The subsampling process will almost always contain different permutations of products $p_i$, so M will vary over some probability distribution.
